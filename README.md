Where a project meets the people who want to help build it.

Show what you are making — an idea, a half-built thing, or something people
already use. Say what it is working on right now, write down its journey as it
goes, and name the help you are looking for. Anyone else can follow along or
join in. Each person's profile is the work with their name on it: what they are
building, and what they helped build.

Next.js on Netlify, with Supabase for both the database and sign-in.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- A Supabase project (free tier is plenty)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your Supabase URL and anon key
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Without `.env.local` the site still runs: it serves the read-only seed from
`app/lib/seed.ts`, so you can work on the pages without a database. Signing in
and everything that writes will say so rather than failing quietly.

## Setting up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Run the files in `supabase/migrations/` **in order**, in the SQL editor. The
   deploy tolerates running ahead of the database — a page loses the feature a
   missing table feeds rather than falling over, and says so in the server log —
   but nothing new works until these are applied:
   - `0001_schema.sql` — tables, constraints, and the `project_overview` view
   - `0002_functions.sql` — the sign-up trigger and the two seat transitions
   - `0003_policies.sql` — row level security
   - `0004_access_and_tasks.sql` — project access levels and the task list
   - `0005_activity.sql` — the activity trail
   - `0006_level_colour.sql` — drops the decorative accent colour
   - `0007_open_roles.sql` — the roles a project is asking for, on the overview
   - `0008_notices.sql` — telling an applicant what was decided
   - `0009_admins_decide_again.sql` — gives admins back the seat decisions
     0008 accidentally took from them
   - `0010_showcase.sql` — what a project is working on now, its journey,
     following, and four levels instead of five
   - `0011_predefined_roles.sql` — the shared, filterable role catalogue
   - `0012_custom_role_titles.sql` — a specific title when a needed role is not
     in that catalogue
   - `0013_people_directory.sql` — searchable profession, skills, experience,
     and fields for the people directory
  - `0014_profile_links.sql` — optional public email, LinkedIn, X, and résumé
    links on portfolio profiles
  - `0015_project_logo_url.sql` — an optional project-owned logo URL
  - `0016_task_role_proposals.sql` — optional task/role links and multi-person
    proposals gated by the talent-pool profile
  - `0017_github_open_contributions.sql` — the explicit GitHub contribution
    badge and its repository safeguard
  - the timestamped files after those, in filename order — Explore's search
    indexes, the brief-length alignment,
    `20260829120000_project_types.sql`, which records what kind of project it
    is (pet project, community, product, commercial) so people browsing can
    pick the kind of collaboration they are looking for, and
    `20260829130000_link_first_projects.sql`, which drops the brief's length
    floors and adds `highlight`, so a project can arrive as a link and be
    written up afterwards
3. Copy the project URL and the **anon** key from Project Settings → API into
   `.env.local`. Never put the `service_role` key in this app; it bypasses every
   policy.
4. Sign up through the site with your own email.
5. Optional: open `supabase/seed.sql`, change `owner_email` at the top to that
   same address, and run it. That imports the starting projects under your
   account.

Email confirmation is on by default in Supabase. The link it sends lands on
`/auth/confirm`, which exchanges the PKCE authorization code for a session.
The callback also accepts `token_hash` and `type` from a custom SSR email
template. If you turn confirmation off, sign-up signs people straight in
instead.

### Google login

1. In Google Auth Platform, configure Branding and Audience, then make sure Data
   Access includes `openid`, `userinfo.email`, and `userinfo.profile`.
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 **Web application** client. Add each app origin under
   Authorized JavaScript origins (for example `http://localhost:3000` and the
   production origin), then add Supabase's callback as an authorized redirect URI:
   `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
3. In Supabase, open Authentication → Providers → Google, enable it, then paste
   the Google client ID and client secret.
4. Under Authentication → URL Configuration, add both app callbacks to the
   **Redirect URLs** allow list, for **every** origin people reach the site on —
   the custom domain, the deploy URL behind it, and local:
   - `<origin>/auth/callback`
   - `<origin>/auth/confirm`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An empty or incomplete Redirect URLs list is the quietest way to break
> sign-in. Supabase does not report a rejected `redirect_to`; it silently
> falls back to the **Site URL**, so the authorization code arrives on a page
> that has no idea what to do with it and the person simply stays signed out.
> Only `/auth/callback` and `/auth/confirm` belong on that list. Nothing else
> in this app trades a code for a session — `/get-started` is where a *successful*
> sign-in lands, and putting it on the allow list would break the very flow it
> is meant to finish.

Sign-in always *starts* at one address. A Netlify site answers to several —
the custom domain, the `*.netlify.app` subdomain behind it, and a per-deploy
permalink like `https://<deploy-id>--<site>.netlify.app` — and the address the
function is invoked with is not always the one in the address bar. Since the
verifier is a cookie, and a cookie belongs to one host, `/auth/google` moves
somebody to the site's primary address *before* writing it (see `pinnedOrigin`
in `app/lib/urls.ts`); everything after that follows the browser instead of
pinning anything. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to name that address, or let
Netlify's own `URL` stand in on production deploys. A sign-in that leaves from
one name and returns on another is what puts `?error=origin-mismatch` on the
sign-in page.

Sign-in starts at `/auth/google`, a route handler, and that is deliberate
rather than incidental. `signInWithOAuth` generates the PKCE code verifier and
writes it as a cookie, and `/auth/callback` reads it back to trade the
authorization code for a session; a verifier that never reaches the browser
fails the callback with a message about a missing verifier, which reads like a
misconfigured redirect URL and is not one. The route handler sets that cookie
on the very redirect that sends somebody to Google — one response carrying both
the destination and the cookie that makes the return trip work. Only
`/auth/callback` and `/auth/confirm` go on Supabase's allow list; `/auth/google`
is an entry point on this site and Supabase never redirects to it.

No Google client secret belongs in this Next.js app. Supabase stores it and the
app only uses the existing public URL and anon key. Supabase's current setup
screens and exact callback value are documented in its
[Google login guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google).
For a branded domain on Google's account screen, configure a Supabase custom
domain such as `auth.example.com` and update Google's authorized redirect URI to
match it.

## How the site is put together

| Route | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | The board — five lanes (`?lane=`), narrowed by level, kind, topic, role, search |
| `/projects/<slug>` | One project: the story, what it is doing now, the help it wants, its journey |
| `/u/<username>` | One person: what they are building, what they helped build, their trail |
| `/new` | Add a project. One field: the link. Its page supplies the name, description and icon; the brief and everything else is optional and can be added later |
| `/get-started` | Where a completed sign-in lands — not a callback, never on the redirect allow list. The steps still owed, and the projects you own; forwards to the board once nothing is owed |
| `/account/profile` | The profile editor — who you are, what puts you in the talent pool, how to reach you |
| `/signin`, `/signup` | Google OAuth or email and password, through Supabase Auth |
| `/about`, `/en/about` | The story behind the name, in Indonesian and English |

### Where the rules live

- `app/lib/brief.ts` — what a project may carry and what it must: a name, and
  a ceiling on everything else. The old floors (a full brief before a project
  could exist) are gone — see `20260829130000_link_first_projects.sql`.
- `app/lib/link-metadata.ts` — reads a pasted link's own title, description and
  icon so adding a project costs one field, and fences that read in so a URL
  from a stranger cannot be pointed at anything private.
- `app/lib/profile.ts` — what a profile may carry. The ceilings are the same
  ones the `profiles` columns check, so a typo comes back as a sentence
  rather than a constraint error.
- `app/lib/next-steps.ts` — the steps `/get-started` lists. Named things with a
  link at each, never a percentage: a profile is not a form to fill to 100%.
- `app/lib/stages.ts` — the levels (`idea → building → live`, plus `resting`)
  and what each one requires. No level asks for a team: working alone is not a
  lesser project. What they ask for is evidence the work has moved — a link, or
  the line saying what is being worked on right now.
- `app/lib/project-types.ts` — what kind of project it is: pet project,
  komunitas, produk berpengguna, komersial. Deliberately a different question
  from the level (how far it has got) and the topic (what it is about): this one
  says why the project exists, and so what joining it actually means. Empty is a
  valid answer for anything made before the question was asked; new projects
  have to pick.
- `app/lib/feed.ts` — the board's lanes, and how the "untuk kamu" lane is
  arranged. Pure, so the unit tests read it directly.
- `app/lib/updates.ts` — the journey a project writes for itself.
- `app/lib/roles.ts` — the kinds of help a project can ask for.
- `app/lib/tasks.ts` — the three task statuses and what a task must carry.
- `app/lib/activity.ts` — the eleven kinds of trail entry and how each one reads
  as a sentence.
- `app/lib/access.ts` — owner, admin, member. Admins run the work — seats,
  applications, the task list. The project itself — the brief, the level,
  deleting it — stays with the owner.
- `app/lib/data.ts` — every read the pages do.
- `app/actions.ts` — every write, as server actions.

**Authorization is the database's job.** The policies in
`supabase/migrations/0003_policies.sql` decide who may read and write; the
checks in the server actions exist to turn a refusal into a readable sentence.
Taking a seat goes through `apply_for_seat()` and `decide_seat()` rather than a
plain update, so an applicant cannot rewrite the role on their way in. Moving a
task goes through `move_task()` for the same reason: row level security is row
level, not column level, so a policy letting the assignee update their own task
would also let them retitle it and hand it to somebody else. `set_now()` is the
third of the same shape — an admin may rewrite the one line saying what the
project is working on, and nothing else on that row.

`projects.now_updated_at` is written by a trigger for the same reason the trail
is: it is the freshness people read to decide whether a project is still alive,
so it must not be something a request can set. `updates` is the other half of
that pair — the journey in the project's own words. It has no UPDATE policy and
no update grant on purpose: an entry can be written and removed, never quietly
reworded after people have read it.

The activity trail is written by triggers, never by the app, and that is a
security decision rather than a tidiness one: if server actions wrote events,
the table would need `grant insert to authenticated`, and anybody could then
POST a fabricated entry into their own trail. As it stands `events` has no write
grant at all — `record_event()` is the only writer, and it returns early when
`auth.uid()` is null, so a migration or `supabase/seed.sql` cannot manufacture
history that never happened.

Hiding a kind of entry is enforced by the SELECT policy on `events`, not by the
query. Filtering in `listPersonActivity()` would leave
`GET /rest/v1/events?actor_id=eq.…` wide open, and the anon key is public by
design.

Two rules in `0004` are worth knowing before changing anything there.
`can_manage_project()` is SECURITY DEFINER because it reads `seats` and is used
inside the policies on `seats` — as INVOKER it would recurse forever. And
`project_overview` is dropped and recreated rather than replaced, because
`create or replace view` keeps the old reloptions silently, so a replacement
that forgets `security_invoker = true` would stop honouring RLS altogether.

## Tests

```bash
npm test        # builds, then runs everything under tests/
npm run test:unit   # just the pure logic, no build
```

`tests/rendered-html.test.mjs` runs the built site with no Supabase credentials,
so it covers every page as a guest. `tests/supabase.test.mjs` is a read-only
smoke test that skips unless credentials are present — it is safe to point at
production.

The policies have their own suite, which needs a scratch PostgreSQL 16:

```bash
createdb ahsan_test
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/local/auth-shim.sql
for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 "$DATABASE_URL" -f "$f"; done
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/tests/policies.sql
```

`supabase/local/auth-shim.sql` is the smallest slice of Supabase's `auth` schema
the migrations touch, so a plain PostgreSQL can run them. It is for development
only — never run it against a hosted project.

## Deployment

Netlify, using `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` (declared in `netlify.toml`). Set these
in Site settings → Environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — the site's primary address. Sign-in starts here, and
  it is the fallback origin for links that leave the app and come back when
  there is no request to read the origin from. On Netlify it may be left unset:
  the primary address in Netlify's own `URL` is used for production deploys.
  If you do set it, set it **per context** — a value shared with deploy previews
  sends a reviewer to sign in on the live site

`siteOrigin()` in `app/lib/origin.ts` prefers the origin the *browser* asked
for — `x-forwarded-host`, not `request.url`, which is the address the function
was invoked with and behind Netlify can be that deploy's permalink. Redirects
inside the app use `sameOriginRedirect()` in `app/lib/redirect.ts` for the same
reason: a relative `Location` leaves the browser on the host holding its
cookies. Following the request rather than a pinned name is deliberate. Signing in writes the PKCE code verifier as a
cookie on the origin it started from, and the callback has to find that cookie
again; a single origin pinned into every link means anybody arriving by a
second name for the site gets sent to the first one, where the verifier is not,
and the sign-in dies at the exchange. So register **every** origin people use
under Authentication → URL Configuration, each with `/auth/callback` and
`/auth/confirm`, not just the canonical one.

That the forwarded host comes from outside is not a hole: Supabase refuses a
`redirect_to` that is not on the allow list, so the list is the guard.

Update `siteUrl` in `app/content.ts` when the site moves to its own domain — it
is the base for canonical and Open Graph URLs.

## Useful commands

- `npm run dev` — local development
- `npm run build` — production build
