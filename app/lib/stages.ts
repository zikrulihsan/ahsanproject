/**
 * Where a project is in its life.
 *
 * Four levels, not five. Somebody browsing is not looking for "a project that
 * is being validated" — they are looking for something being built that they
 * could help with, so validation is a step in the journey rather than a status
 * of its own, and it lives in the project's updates now.
 *
 * Working alone is not a lesser project — most of the board started that way —
 * so no level asks for a team. What each level asks for is evidence the work
 * has actually moved: something written down, something being worked on right
 * now, something other people can open.
