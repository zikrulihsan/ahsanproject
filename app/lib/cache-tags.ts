/**
 * The names cached reads are filed under, and writes invalidate.
 *
 * Kept in one small module with no Supabase import so both sides can reach it:
 * `data.ts` tags its `use cache` scopes with these, and `actions.ts` calls
 * `updateTag` with the same names after a write. A tag that only one side
 * knows about is a stale page nobody can explain, so they are never spelled
 * out inline.
 *
 * Two levels, deliberately:
 *
 *   - the broad tags (`projects`, `people`, `seats`) cover the lists, where a
 *     single new project changes every filtered view of the board and there is
 *     no cheap way to say which;
 *   - the narrow ones (`project(slug)`, `person(username)`) cover the detail
 *     pages, so editing one project does not throw away every other one.
 *
 * A write usually touches both: `updateProject` invalidates its own page and
 * the lists it appears in.
