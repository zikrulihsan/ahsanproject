/**
 * What kind of thing a project is.
 *
 * A different question from `stages.ts` and from the topic tags, and it has to
 * stay that way or the three collapse into one muddled label. A stage says how
 * far the work has got; a topic says what it is about; the type here says why
 * it exists — and, because of that, what joining it actually means for whoever
 * offers to help.
 *
 * That last part is the whole reason this exists. Somebody scanning the board
 * is not only asking "can I do this work"; they are asking "do I want this kind
 * of arrangement". A weekend experiment where nothing is expected of you and a
 * product with paying customers can want the very same role and be completely
 * different things to say yes to. Without this, the only way to find that out
 * was to read the brief and guess.
 *
 * Store the key, never the label — the same rule as `roles.ts`. The Indonesian
 * copy can be rewritten without touching a single row.
