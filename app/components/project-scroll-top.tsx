 *
 * The boundary is here rather than at each call site: `usePathname()` reads the
 * URL, which is not known while a route is being prerendered, and a page that
 * had to wait for it could not ship a static shell. This component draws
 * nothing, so an empty fallback costs the page nothing while it resolves.
