/**
 * Cache Components is what makes this site cheap to serve.
 *
 * Every route used to carry `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, so each page view
 * re-read Supabase from scratch — including the two story pages, which have no
 * database reads at all. With `cacheComponents` on, each route prerenders a
 * static shell, the public reads in `app/lib/data.ts` are cached and shared
 * across visitors, and only the parts that genuinely depend on who is looking
 * (the header, the inbox, an application state) stream in at request time.
 *
 * The profiles below name the shapes of data this site has, so a call site
 * reads as an intent rather than a number. All three are also invalidated on
 * demand: every write in `app/actions.ts` calls `updateTag`, so an edit shows
 * up immediately and the durations are only the ceiling for changes that
 * happen outside the app.
