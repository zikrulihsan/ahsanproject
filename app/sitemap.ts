 * Every page worth finding from outside.
 *
 * Profiles are the point of this file as much as projects are: a portfolio
 * nobody can find is not doing any promoting. Pages behind a sign-in
 * (`/inbox`, `/new`, the edit form) are left out — they already say
 * `robots: noindex` for themselves.
 *
 * A database that is unreachable costs the listing, not the file: the static
 * routes still ship, so crawlers get something rather than a 500.
